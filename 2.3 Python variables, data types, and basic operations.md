# Chapter 2.3: Python Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations

In this section, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of variables, data types, and basic operations in Python. These concepts are the building blocks of any Python program and are essential to understand as you dive deeper into Python programming.

## Section 2.3.1: Variables

### Introduction to Variables

Variables are used to store data in a Python program. Think of them as containers that hold information that can be manipulated or used in computations. To create a variable, you need to assign a value to it.

#### Example:

```python
# Creating a variable named 'age' and assigning it the value 25
age = 25
```

### Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- They can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., 'myVar' and 'myvar' are different).
- Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., 'if', 'while', 'for') as variable names.

#### Examples of Valid Variable Names:

```python
name = "John"
age = 30
_user = "Alice"
```

#### Examples of Invalid Variable Names:

```python
3total = 100  # Starts with a number
my-variable = 42  # Contains a hyphen
for = 5  # Reserved keyword
```

## Section 2.3.2: Data Types

### Introduction to Data Types

Python supports various data types, each with its characteristics and uses. Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming.

#### Common Data Types in Python:

In Python, data types are used to classify values, and they are crucial for understanding how data is stored and manipulated in your programs. Here, I'll introduce you to some of the most commonly used data types in Python.

### 1. Numeric Types:
Python supports various numeric types for representing numbers:

**a. Integers (`int`):** These are whole numbers, either positive or negative. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = -3
```

**b. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):** These are numbers with decimal points. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14159
```

**c. Complex Numbers (`complex`):** These numbers have a real and an imaginary part. For example:

```python
z = 2 + 3j
```

### 2. Sequence Types:
Sequence types represent ordered collections of items. The most common sequence types in Python are:

**a. Strings (`str`):** Strings represent text and are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example:

```python
name = "Alice"
```

**b. Lists (`list`):** Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**c. Tuples (`tuple`):** Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be modified after creation). For example:

```python
coordinates = (2, 3)
```

### 3. Mapping Type:
**a. Dictionaries (`dict`):** Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it maps to a value. For example:

```python
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
```

### 4. Set Types:
**a. Sets (`set`):** Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are often used for tasks like removing duplicates from a list. For example:

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### 5. Boolean Type:
**a. Booleans (`bool`):** Booleans represent two values: `True` and `False`. They are often used in conditional statements and comparisons. For example:

```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
```

### 6. None Type:
**a. None (`NoneType`):** The `None` type represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or result is uninitialized or empty. For example:

```python
no_value = None
```

### 7. Other Types:
Python supports other data types like `byte`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`, and user-defined classes.

These are the fundamental data types in Python. Understanding and using the appropriate data types is essential for effective programming. Python's dynamic typing system allows variables to change data types during runtime, making it versatile for various tasks.

### Type and Type Conversion

You can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

#### Example:

```python
# Convert a string to an integer
num_str = "42"
num_int = int(num_str)
```

The `type()` function in Python is used to determine the data type of a variable or an expression. It returns the data type as a class object. Here's how you can use the `type()` function with examples for each of the common data types in Python:

### 1. Integers (`int`):

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### 2. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):

```python
pi = 3.14159
print(type(pi))  # Output: <class 'float'>
```

### 3. Complex Numbers (`complex`):

```python
z = 2 + 3j
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
```

### 4. Strings (`str`):

```python
name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

### 5. Lists (`list`):

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(type(numbers))  # Output: <class 'list'>
```

### 6. Tuples (`tuple`):

```python
coordinates = (2, 3)
print(type(coordinates))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>
```

### 7. Dictionaries (`dict`):

```python
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
print(type(person))  # Output: <class 'dict'>
```

### 8. Sets (`set`):

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(type(unique_numbers))  # Output: <class 'set'>
```

### 9. Booleans (`bool`):

```python
is_raining = True
print(type(is_raining))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

### 10. None (`NoneType`):

```python
no_value = None
print(type(no_value))  # Output: <class 'NoneType'>
```

The `type()` function is handy for debugging and ensuring that you are working with the expected data types in your code. It helps you identify and resolve issues related to data type mismatches.


## Section 2.3.3: Basic Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

Python supports all basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder).

#### Example:

```python
# Arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 5

addition_result = a + b  # 15
subtraction_result = a - b  # 5
multiplication_result = a * b  # 50
division_result = a / b  # 2.0 (float)
modulus_result = a % b  # 0
```

### String Operations

Strings in Python can be concatenated using the `+` operator, repeated using the `*` operator, and sliced to extract substrings.

#### Example:

```python
greeting = "Hello, "
name = "Alice"

full_greeting = greeting + name  # "Hello, Alice"
repeated_greeting = greeting * 3  # "Hello, Hello, Hello, "
substring = name[0:3]  # "Ali"
```

### List Operations

Lists support various operations like adding elements, removing elements, accessing elements by index, and more.

#### Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Adding an element to the list
my_list.append(4)

# Accessing an element by index
second_element = my_list[1]  # 2

# Removing an element by value
my_list.remove(3)
```
